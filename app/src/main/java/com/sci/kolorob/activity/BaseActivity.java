 *
 * This activity will hold the basic actions of every activity of the application,
 * which may include log-in/session checks, drawer item initilization, overflow-menu configuration,
 * toolbar setup and so on.
 * Any special inheritance like ActionBarActivity, SherlockActivity, AppcompatActivity
 * etc can also be configured using this single entry-point activity.
 *
 * For now, Kolorob demo app does not have any of such actions, which does not imply it WILL never ;)
